# Female-pattern-hair-loss-Risk-factor-for-atherosclerosis
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), is the most common hair loss disorder affecting both men and women, and is characterized by progressive, patterned hair loss from the scalp. Genes and hormones are implicated in the pathophysiology of this hair type disorder. The clinical change in hair density, related to a change in the hair cycle and miniaturization of the hair follicle, is generally considered to be potentially reversible. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum lipids profile in females with female pattern hair loss and their possible effect on the development of atherosclerosis in Egyptian women.
